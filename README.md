Welcome to the Bottom RedOx model wiki!

Bottom RedOx Model(BROM) is a group of coupled benthic-pelagic models for simulation of water and sediment biogeochemistry. 
BROM is compatible with the Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models [FABM](https://github.com/fabm-model).
It consists of transport models (BROM_transport and IPBM) and biogeochemical model BROM_biogeochemistry. 

[Published version](https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/10/453/2017/) (BROM v.1.1) could be found here  :
[BROM_transport](https://github.com/e-yakushev/brom-git/releases) , [BROM_biogeochemistry](https://github.com/fabm-model/fabm/tree/master/src/models/niva/brom).

[Published version](https://www.geosci-model-dev-discuss.net/gmd-2017-299/gmd-2017-299.pdf) of IPBM could be found [here](https://github.com/limash/IPBM/releases).

Since the publication, the code has been significantly changed. 
Here are current versions of [BROM_transport](https://github.com/BottomRedoxModel/brom-git), [BROM_biogeochemistry](https://github.com/BottomRedoxModel/brom_niva_module) and [IPBM](https://github.com/BottomRedoxModel/IPBM). 

Case scenarios for different geographical positions are in repositories with names "data_Name_of_case".

Currently, there are such available case scenarios: 
1. Urmia lake [data_urmia](https://github.com/BottomRedoxModel/data_urmia)
1. Berre lagoon [data_berre](https://github.com/BottomRedoxModel/data_berre),
1. Hardangerfjord [data_hardangerfjord](https://github.com/BottomRedoxModel/data_hardangerfjord),
1. Eastern Baltic Sea [data_baltic](https://github.com/BottomRedoxModel/data_baltic),
1. Lindesnes [data_lindesnes](https://github.com/BottomRedoxModel/data_lindesnes),
